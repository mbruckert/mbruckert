# Welcome ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mark Bruckert and I am a student at the University of Central Florida.

I'm currently working on a startup called Toolcharm. At ToolCharm, we are building foundational AI to solve software integration problems. Anyone who has build software knows that there is a constant demand from customers/users for their various applications like CRMs, Task Managers, Calendars, Email Providers, etc. to work with the software they use. However, most companies donâ€™t have the engineering time or resources to build out integrations for each of these platforms.

We are currently working on the Actions API to solve this issue. Hereâ€™s how it works:

### **One-Click Authentication, in your UI.**

We handle authenticating your users to hundreds of services in just one-click via just an API call so they can be used with the ToolCharm ecosystem.

### **Make the request and youâ€™re done.**

Just describe the action you wish for ToolCharm to take (regardless of the service), the input data, and set a desired output format - we'll handle the rest.
