# Welcome ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mark Bruckert and I am a high school student at Crooms Academy and will be attending UCF in the fall. I build many of my projects using React on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end. When it comes to the interface design of my projects, I utilize Figma (https://www.figma.com/@mark).
