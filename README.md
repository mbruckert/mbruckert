# Welcome ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mark Bruckert and I am a student at the University of Central Florida. I am currently serving as the Vice President of Knight Hacks, helping plan our large hackathon in October. I build many of my projects using React on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end. When it comes to the design of my projects, I use Figma (https://www.figma.com/@mark).

I'm currently working on a startup called Toolcharm. ToolCharm is an AI Company that allows you to work at the 'Speed of Thought' through an AI Assistant which knows how to use all of the SaaS tools that you use in your company and can complete monotonous tasks for you.
